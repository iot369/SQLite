Disclaimer of Warranty


This software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind. 

The entire and exclusive liability and remedy for breach of this limited 
warranty shall be limited to replacement of defective media or documentation 
and shall not include or extend to any claim for or right to recover any other 
damages, including but not limited to, loss of profit, data, or use of the 
software or special, incidental or consequential damages, or other similar 
claims, even if the author has been specifically advised of the possibility of 
such damages. In no event will the author's liability for any damages to the end 
user or any other person ever exceed the lower of the list price or the actual 
price paid for the license to use the software, regardless of the form of the 
claim. 

THE AUTHOR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, OR 
CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY 
OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ALL OTHER 
IMPLIED TERMS ARE EXCLUDED. 

Specifically, the author makes no representation or warranty that the software 
or documentation are "error-free", or meet any user's particular standards, 
requirements, or needs. In all events, any implied warranty, representation, 
condition or other term is limited to the physical media and documentation and 
is limited to the 90-day duration of the limited warranty. The author is not 
responsible for, and does not make any representation, warranty, or condition 
concerning product, media, software, or documentation not manufactured or 
supplied by the author, such as third-parties' programs that are designed using
the author programs or files. 

General

This license will be construed under the laws of the state of Florida, except 
for that body of law dealing with conflicts of law. If any provision of this 
License shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, 
that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the 
remaining provisions of this license will remain in full force and effect.
